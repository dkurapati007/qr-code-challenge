# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

Introduction
This repository contains my solution for the QR Code Component Challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved creating a QR code component using HTML and CSS.

What I Learned
Semantic HTML:

I gained a deeper understanding of semantic HTML tags and their impact on accessibility and SEO.

Alt Text for Images:

I learned how to write meaningful alt text for images.
Instead of generic terms like “image” or “photo,” I now provide descriptive alt attributes (e.g., “QR code to frontendmentor.io”).

CSS Styling Techniques:

I explored CSS styling options to center the component on the page.
Flexbox and Grid layout were particularly useful for achieving the desired layout.
